Through Jupyter notebook Homework, I learned about the forest-fire model. 
In addition, we investigated the fractal dimension of the forest-fire model 
and discovered that it has self-organized criticality behavior. 
However, in this article, the authors argue that if the model is truly critical. 
They claim not only there is no way to prove its criticality, 
but there is also numerical evidence that the model does not become scale-free. 
They simulated the forest-fire model with size as large as 32000 (length) and 
claimed that the model is not critical in the sense of simple scaling
