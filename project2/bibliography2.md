We studied Schelling's dynamic model of segregation where individual agents looked around their neightborhood, and moved throguh the two dimensional lattice structure. In this paper, the authors did a similar experiment except that they performed the experiment on the social, small-world networks instead of the two-dimentional lattices. In the paper, they discuss two different models: global-move model and local-move model. Global model allows agents to move arbitrarily far away while the local model allowed agents to choose an alternative location in their social neighborhood. According to the result of this paper, their result for both models is very similar to Schelling's result. Leading to conclusion that Schelling's original model was quite rubust.
