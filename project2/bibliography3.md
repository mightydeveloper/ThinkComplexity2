In this paper, the authors implemented a computational, agent-based model which simulates the biological cells and investigated social behaviour of cells. 
To compare with the real cells, the authors compared the model with epithelial cells in monolayer culture, using growth media with low and physiological calcium concentrations. In result section, the paper explains that in both biological and computational systems, cell were fairly evenly distributed over the substrate in the low calcium conditions, but showed an increased tendency to form colonies when exposed to higher concentrations of calcium. As for conclution, it claims that even with very simple set of rules, the intercellular bonding and basic physical relationships between neighboring cells can successfully reproduces the behavior of a real biological system.
