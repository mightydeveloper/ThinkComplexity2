This paper focuses on the dynamics of information diffusion in techno-social systems. The first question that the paper tries to address is whether information spreads according to simple or complex dynamics. This paper suggests two Bayesian statistical models describing simple and complex contagion dynamics in order to test the competing hypothesis. In order to support the model, the paper provided experimental evidence that the complex model describes the information diffusion behavior better than the simple contagion. One interesting future work mentioned in this paper is making a model to protect against the malicious propaganda campaigns on social media, or other advertisements.
