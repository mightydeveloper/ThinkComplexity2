This paper tries to model using agent-based methods to construct a network that is close to the Facebook network graph. This is quite analogous to the class lecture where we tried to model that has some of interesting properties which is also in the Facebook network graph. Indeed, this paper has figures that compute degrees of separation, and also degree distribution (in log-log graph!!). It was very interesting to see that the suggested model follows the Facebook graph quite well. Although the model fits quite well with some of the properties, the main part of this paper focuses on the message (wall post) propagation within Facebook network. Also, the paper criticizes that the current EdgeRank (news feed ranking algorithm) gives too much weight on the recency, and left as a future work to improve the algorithm
