In the paper â€˜Network Analysis in the Social Sciences, the authors tried to review many of the researches done in social science through observing and experimenting through analyzing the networks. They introduced some other researches that tries various methods to analyze the network. For example, some worked with rigorous mathematics using matrix algebra and graph theory, while some empirically analyzed the real world using simpler models. For concluding remarks, this paper argues that physical sciences tend to simplify the model too much, while the social sciences tend to be more complex. I believe this argument is still valid and consistent with our studies in the reading.
